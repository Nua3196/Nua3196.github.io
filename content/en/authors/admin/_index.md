## Hello!

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a junior in the Department of Computer Science at Jeonbuk National University.
I believe the best part of being a university student is that you can spend time learning new things without worrying about what others think.
I enjoy taking classes in my major. As long as my schedule allows, my goal is to take all the major classes I want before graduation.
I am currently interested in operating systems, embedded systems, and system security, but I am still exploring my career path and areas of interest. Recently, I've also had a bit of interest in Artificial Intelligence. Regardless of the field I pursue, my goal is to become an engineer who is knowledgeable and professional in my major.
